/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "The Rescue Circle" application. 
 *  "The rescue Circle" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users

 *  to make it more interesting!
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
